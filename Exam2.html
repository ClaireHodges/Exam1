<p id="p1"><span id="cool">I</span> am going to teach you some English words, which is why there rock above this text has no meaning whatsoever. A bin is short for rubbish bin, which is the equivalent of a trash can, except it sounds more posh. Spelling is slightly different, so when in doubt add a "u" after an o when an "r" is after it. Also, change all the words that end is "-ize" to "ise" for a more British spelling. Now, there are a few pronounciation differences as well, the two most important being "water" and "aluminum" (which for some odd reason is now being said by everyone in America). For water, pronounce the "wa" more like "war", then put emphasis on the the "t" so it's pronounced more like the t in "tee" (pronounciation fo the letter), rather than a "d". For aluminum, prounce "al" like the name "Al". Then just say "you-min-ee-um". P.S.- in England it is spelt aluminium. </p>

<p class="p2">Now for the most important part- quite. In England, quite means a little bit. For example, if you said "I'm quite hungry", it would mean that you were a little bit hungry. In America, the official definition is very, so if you thought that quite meant a little bit everywhere then you've been reading way to many books from England!</p>

<p class="p2">Main Points:</p>

<ol type="I" id="list">
    <li>More "u"s</li>
    <li>"s", not "z"</li>
    <li>quite is a little bit</li>
</ol>
